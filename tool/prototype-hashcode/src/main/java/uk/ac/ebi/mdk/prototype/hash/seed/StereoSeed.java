/**
 * StereoSeed - 2011.11.11 <br>
 * The StereoSeed allows hashing of stereo-chemical features.
 * Exclusion of these seed will results in stereo-isomers scoring the
 * same hash code.
 * <p/>
 * <br>
 * You can add the stereo seed seed to the default methods used in the
 * hash. Note that the seed can also be added in the
 * {@see uk.ac.ebi.core.tools.hash.MolecularHashFactory#getHash(IAtomContainer, Set)}
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *          MolecularHashFactory factory = MolecularHashFactory.getInstance();
 *          factory.addSeedMethod(SeedFactory.getInstance().getSeed(StereoSeed.class));
 *          factory.getHash(molecule); // uses StereoSeed (in addition to the default)
 *          </pre>
 *
 * @author johnmay
 * @author $Author$ (this version)
 * @version $Rev$ : Last Changed $Date$ 
 * deprecated - this method use the CIP rules which are very slow - when hashing we can take a short cut
 *              which is build into the hash code factory
