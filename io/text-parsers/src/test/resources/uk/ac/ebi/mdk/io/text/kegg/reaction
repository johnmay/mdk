DEFINITION  Urea-1-carboxylate + H2O <=> 2 CO2 + 2 NH3
EQUATION    C01010 + C00001 <=> 2 C00011 + 2 C00014
COMMENT     The yeast enzyme (but not that from green algae) also catalyses the
            reaction of EC 6.3.4.6 urea carboxylase, thus bringing about the
            hydrolysis of urea to CO2 and NH3 in the presence of ATP and
            bicarbonate.
